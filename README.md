# Team Profile Generator

# Description
- At the start of the challenge a repository containing the framework for a team profile generator, as well as multiple tests to insure the webpage was made correctly was inherited. The task was to use the npm inquirer package to produce a webpage displaying all the members of the users team.
- This type of program could benefit the user as it provides a simplistic way of generating a webpage that displays all the members of your team. The user can add as many team members that they want and can specify the role of each team member. Furthermore, for each specific role the inquirer program will ask tailor made question fo that specific role.
- Throughout this project I learnt how to use npm tests to ensure that my program was coded effectively. Working with inquirer more also taught me how to add functions to each layer of an inquiry so that you can avoid repetitive code.
